**Project Name**: Pendeteksi Wajah untuk Menentukan Umur dan Jenis Kelamin

## Background
Facial recognition technology has advanced rapidly and is now applied across various sectors, such as security, marketing, and attendance systems. One of the key capabilities of this technology is its ability to detect demographic attributes, such as gender, from a person's face. Gender detection based on facial features can be used for customer analysis, data automation, and the development of more personalized AI applications.

However, most facial recognition systems still rely on real-time input from cameras. This is not always ideal, especially when users want to analyze previously stored images. Therefore, a system is needed that can detect faces and classify gender from static images uploaded by users.
This project aims to build a Python-based system that can detect faces and classify gender based on uploaded images. The system will be integrated into a website, allowing users to upload images and receive face analysis results directly through the web platform.

## Objectives
1) Develop a facial detection system capable of detecting and recognizing faces in static images uploaded by users.
2) Develop a gender classification algorithm based on detected faces, enabling the system to automatically identify the gender of users.
3) Improve the accuracy of face detection and gender classification by addressing factors such as lighting, angle, and image quality.
4) Integrate the face detection and gender classification system into a website, so users can easily upload images and receive analysis results directly.

## Benefits
1) With a face detection and gender classification system for uploaded images, users can easily obtain demographic information from images without needing real-time camera input.
2) This project enables the automation of face and gender analysis processes, reducing the time and effort required for manual analysis. This can be useful for applications such as marketing and customer data analysis.

## System Targets
1) Face Detection
2) Gender Classification
3) Accuracy and Performance
4) Simple interface for input and output results
